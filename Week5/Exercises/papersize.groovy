/* A Din-A0 sheet of paper is 841mm × 1189mm (its surface is one square meter). Successive measurements of paper
are defined recursively as “half” or “double” the preceding size. Therefore, a Din-A1 sheet of paper is half of
Din-A0, or 594mm × 841mm; while a Din-A00 is double of Din-A0, or 1189mm× 1682mm.
Create a method that takes a String parameter representing a size (e.g. ”A4”, “A00000”) and prints on screen
the size of the corresponding sheet of paper. For simplicity, you can ignore rounding errors when calculating smaller
sizes.
Hint: note that two consecutive sizes always share one side and only the other one is multiplied or divided by
two, e.g. the short side of Din-A2 is as long as the long side of Din-A3, while the long side of Din-A2 is twice as
long as the short side of Din-A3.

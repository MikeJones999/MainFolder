/*Write a program that reads the X and Y coordinates of two points and then outputs the area of a rectangle where
both points are opposite corners. Use the following class to store the data for the points:
class Rectangle {
Point upLeft;
Point downRight;
}
Your program should calculate (and write on the screen) the perimeter and area of the rectangle.
